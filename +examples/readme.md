The +examples folder contains MATLAB live scripts which each have demonstrations of SONIC use cases. 
These examples are not comprehensive, but show the general work flow of using the SONIC building 
blocks to solve more complex problems.

- **ScanLinesTutorial.mlx** Demonstrates the generic ability to extract image values along a specified scanline, which is useful for horizon-based OPNAV.
- **SyntheticStarImgTutorial.mlx** Demonstrates creating a synthetic image of the star Arcturus, and its surrounding starfield in SONIC. Being able to construct an expected image is an essential operation for OPNAV.
- **TriangVestaReconTutorial.mlx** Illustrates the use of the triangulation in SONIC to perform 3D structure reconstruction on the asteroid Vesta from features extracted in images. A few different approaches to triangulation
