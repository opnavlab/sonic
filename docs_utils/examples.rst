Examples with SONIC
=================================

As demonstration of a few applications of SONIC to real world OPNAV problem, the following example MATLAB live scripts were created.

- `Create Scan Lines in Image <_static/ScanLinesTutorial.html>`_: Demonstrates the generic ability to extract image values along a specified scanline, which is useful for horizon-based OPNAV.
- `Generate Synthetic Star Image <_static/SyntheticStarImgTutorial.html>`_: Demonstrates creating a synthetic image of the star Arcturus, and its surrounding starfield in SONIC. Being able to construct an expected image is an essential operation for OPNAV.
- `3D Reconstruction of Vesta <_static/TriangVestaReconTutorial.html>`_: Illustrates the use of the triangulation in SONIC to perform 3D structure reconstruction on the asteroid Vesta from features extracted in images. A few different approaches to triangulation are provided in SONIC, which can be used both for estimating the spacecraft state or reconstruction.
- `Crater Rim Fitting <_static/CraterEllipseFittingTutorial.html>`_: Perform crater ellipse fitting using an image of Ceres, as captured by the Dawn spacecraft.
- `Reflectance Modeling <_static/ReflectanceModelingTutorial.html>`_: Demonstrate how to use reflectance models available under the sonic.Reflectance class.
- `OrthoSphere Rendering with Reflectance Models <_static/RenderOrthoSphereTutorial.html>`_: Demonstrate how to render orthographic projections of spheres with homogenous surfaces using reflectance models provided in SONIC.
