SONIC Tutorials
=================================

SONIC is designed to be a versatile toolkit for many OPNAV applications. For illustrative and learning purposes, MATLAB live tutorials for some example applications are listed here.

`Synthetic Star Image <_static/SyntheticStarImgTutorial.html>`_: Demonstration of creating a synthetic image of the star Arcturus, and its surrounding starfield. 
This example shows how to set up a camera model with distortion and utilize the Hipparcos catalog to project a starfield to create a synthetic image.

`Vesta 3D Reconstruction <_static/TriangVestaReconTutorial.html>`_: Through use of the triangulation capabilities integrated into SONIC, this example shows the process of 3D
reconstruction of the asteroid Vesta from features detected by a camera.

`Scaning an Image <_static/ScanLinesTutorial.html>`_: Using the convenient geometric representation of lines in SONIC, this example demonstrates the ability to easily 
run image scans in SONIC.
