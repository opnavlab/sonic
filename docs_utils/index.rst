SONIC API Documentation
=================================

This open-sourced, object oriented MATLAB package is a toolkit built on years of research in
optical navigation (OPNAV), with a foundation in principled projective geometry. Many 
capabilities needed for space-flight OPNAV are made transparent and configurable within the SONIC classes, 
with minimal assumption of the analyst's intentions. This allows each user to construct their own 
unique workflows for a specific research or analysis problems. SONIC was designed to help simplify navigation solutions such as (but not limited to):

- Horizon-Based OPNAV
- Triangulation
- Star Identification
- 3D-Reconstruction
- And more

SONIC was created by the researchers and students of the `Space Exploration and Design 
Laboratory <https://seal.ae.gatech.edu/>`_ at the Georgia Institute of Technology for student, 
academic researchers, space science professionals, or anyone curious to learn more about OPNAV.
