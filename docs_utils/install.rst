Installing SONIC
=================================

Minimal preparation is needed to begin using SONIC. Simply clone the repository locally, and add the sonic directory to the search path that you're working in (i.e. using addpath).

A few MATLAB live tutorials are provided under +examples for demonstrative purposes.
To verify your installation of SONIC, please run these examples locally and compare the outputs to the pre-run demos in the SONIC API documentation, linked below.

Note: SONIC requires the following MATLAB toolboxes installed:

-Image Processing Toolbox version 24.1
-Computer Vision System Toolbox version 24.1
