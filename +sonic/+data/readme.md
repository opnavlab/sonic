The +sonic/+data folder contains catalog data which has been stored in mat files for use with SONIC. The mat files contain the data as given in the original sources, but when the catalog objects are instantiated, units are converted to be consistent with SONIC standards. The current catalogs and their sources are listed below:
- Hipparcos: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hipparcos/interactive-data-access
- US Naval Observatory GNC Catalog: https://crf.usno.navy.mil/icrs
- Robbins crater catalog: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/moon_crater_database_v1_robbins
