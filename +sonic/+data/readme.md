Download the .mat data files from the link provided in the top-level SONIC README.md, and place them in the +sonic/+data folder within your local repository. 

These .mat files to be placed in +sonic/+data contain catalog data for use with SONIC. The data fields are as given in the original sources, but when the catalog objects are instantiated, units are converted to be consistent with SONIC standards. The current catalogs and their sources are listed below:
- Hipparcos: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hipparcos/interactive-data-access
- US Naval Observatory GNC Catalog: https://crf.usno.navy.mil/icrs
- Robbins crater catalog: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/moon_crater_database_v1_robbins
