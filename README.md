# **S**oftware for **O**ptical **N**avigation and **I**nstrument **C**alibration
This open-sourced, object oriented MATLAB package is a toolkit built on years of research in
optical navigation (OPNAV), with a foundation in principled projective geometry. Many 
capabilities needed for OPNAV are made transparent and configurable within the SONIC classes, 
with minimal assumption of the analyst's intentions, such that full workflows can be 
created and applied to mission specific or individual problems. 

SONIC was created by the researchers and students of the [Space Exploration and Design 
Laboratory](https://seal.ae.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology for academics, 
industry projects, or anyone curious to learn more about OPNAV.

# Getting Started
Minimal preparation is needed to begin using SONIC. Simply clone the repository locally,
and point your working directory to the SONIC path. 

Note: As of 5/16/2024, SONIC has a few MATLAB toolbox dependencies which will
require installation prior to full operation.

A few tutorials are provided under +examples as demonstrative use-cases of SONIC.
